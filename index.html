    <h1 class="fontsDes">Durango, dgo., México</h1>
    <p class="fontsDes">Durango, officially named Estado Libre y Soberano de Durango (English: Free and Sovereign State of Durango; Tepehuán: Korian; Nahuatl: Tepēhuahcān), is one of the 31 states which make up the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico, situated in the northwest of the country. With a population of 1,832,650, the 8th lowest of Mexico's states, Durango has Mexico's second-lowest population density, after Baja California Sur. The capital city, Victoria de Durango, is named after the first President of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria.</p>
    <p class="fontsDes">Durango is been a really classical city with a lot of buildings with such a romantical style. Trhough the years it's been getting modern but keeping the classic style that speaks for itself. </p>

    <p class="fontsDes">My favorite food from the city is nothing traditional but it is made for Duranguense people, and it is the most known pizza in the city: Bendita pizza.</p>

    <ul class="fontul"> Interesting points of the city
        <li class="fontsDes">The first place to visit, could be the center of the city, where there's a lot of places to eat, do shopping or stay just talking outdoor in one of the many banches. And of course, depending on the season, you would be seeing all kinds of decorations.</li>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/naq4NxF.png" alt="An image from one of the decorated places at the center in nightime." class="listimages">
        <li class="fontsDes">You can also Visit El Mirador, one of the highest places on the city. You can actually see the entire city from this place, and use the cableway to cross from this point to be in El Calvario.</li>

        <li class="fontsDes">El Calvario even being connected directly with El Mirador, is one of the quite but most visited places. Not only because it is the other tip of the cableway, it is because here are one of the most used places for students and artist because of the theater known as El Teatro del Calvario.
            This teather is completely outdoors and offers a pretty view at sundowns. But not only the teather, here are also some of the popular restaurants.
