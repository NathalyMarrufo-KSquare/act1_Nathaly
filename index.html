        <li class="fontsDes">El Calvario even being connected directly with El Mirador, is one of the quite but most visited places. Not only because it is the other tip of the cableway, it is because here are one of the most used places for students and artist because of the theater known as El Teatro del Calvario.
            This teather is completely outdoors and offers a pretty view at sundowns. But not only the teather, here are also some of the popular restaurants.
